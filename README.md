# osint_packages
osint packages is just a simple shell script to install multiple gihtub repositories and installing them automatically,
this is all done through shell script and all I put all of the combined requirements into one file as well for easy installation.
This makes it almost like a kali build with separated tools rather than all of them put together.

# installation
```
git clone https://github.com/fukboi69420/osint_packages
cd osint_packages
chmod +x osint.sh
./osint.sh
```
everything should be done automatically if i coded this right.
if there are missing requirements copy and paste
```
cd osint_packages
pip3 insatll -r requirements.txt
```
and then run wichever desired program you want, and it should all be pre set-up.
